# 🍻 Beer Contest – React App with External API

**Beer Contest** is a playful and interactive React web app created as part of my training at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/). The main objective was to build a complete frontend project using an **external REST API**.

The app features a **beer-themed card game** and a light **personality quiz**, both powered by live data fetched from a public API.

Deployed with **Vercel** for quick and easy access online.
